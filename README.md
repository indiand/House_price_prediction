🏠 House Price Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts house prices using a Linear Regression model. The model is trained on a Kaggle dataset and deployed as a web application using Streamlit.

📌 Project Overview

The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that predicts house prices based on input features.
The trained model is saved using pickle and integrated into a Streamlit UI for easy user interaction.
